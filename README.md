# overview-frontend

Overview is an app that allows the user to keep track of their inventory. A shopping list is automatically generated based on item quantities that are less than their target quantities.

This is the frontend portion of a full stack project. This project furthered my understanding of the relationships between components in React JS. I also gained experience making different types of requests from the frontend to the backend.
