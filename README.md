# overview-frontend

Overview is an app that allows the user to keep track of their inventory.

Key Features:

- Effortless Addition and Deletion: The app allows users to effortlessly add new items to their inventory while also providing a straightforward mechanism to remove items that are no longer needed.
- Editing: Users have the flexibility to modify existing items, adjusting details such as name, amount, and target values with ease.
- Smart Shopping List Generation: A standout feature of Overview is its automatic shopping list generation. The app intelligently identifies items whose inventory falls below the target value and creates a shopping list to replenish these items.
- Smart Shopping List Management: The generated shopping list includes precise item quantities needed. By utilizing a checkmark system, users can mark items as purchased, and Overview will automatically adjust the inventory amount and remove the item from the shopping list.


This is the frontend portion of a full stack project. This project furthered my understanding of the relationships between components in React JS. I also gained experience making different types of requests from the frontend to the backend.
